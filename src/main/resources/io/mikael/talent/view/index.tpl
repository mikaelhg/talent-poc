What's New

This page provides value in two different ways for two different audiences:

A. 1.0: For people who haven't logged in, it explains the concept behind the application.

   1.2: Also, fancy screenshots or concept pics.

B. 1.0:  For those who have logged in, it shows a "What's New" view of new
   (unseen) projects, new recommendations, etc.

   1.0: Under the new information, the user sees a list of currently open projects.

   1.2: As the user scrolls down the list of new information, projects and
   recommendations are marked as "seen".
